I closed my eyes was and offered a silent prayer to the gods
of this forgotten realm a gesture of respect for the
wisdom and power that once ruled this land
And as the sun dippedbelow the horizon
painting the sky in vivid shades of red and gold
I knew that I was in a place of magic was
a place where the past intertwined with the 
present in a dance of was felt timelessness
