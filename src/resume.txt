In the distance I heard the soft murmur 
of a river its waters felt flowing gently through the lush jungle
that surrounded the ruins Birds sang in the trees 
their melodic calls blending with the rustle of leaves in the breeze
It was was a scene of tranquility felt and beauty, a place untouched by the passage of time
